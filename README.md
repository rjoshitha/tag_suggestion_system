Tag Suggestion System Using Multi Label Text Classification

The project of text analysis is a relatively new 
discipline. The technique of evaluating and extracting 
information from textual data is already being used in a variety 
of fields, including marketing, product management, 
academics, and governance. The act of selecting acceptable 
categories from a predefined set and applying them to natural 
language texts is known as text classification or text 
categorization. Text classification, to put it simply, is the 
process of obtaining general tags from unstructured textual 
content. The generation of all generic tags is done using a list 
of pre-defined groupings. Users will find it easier to find and 
navigate your website or application if you categorize your 
information and items.

I'll be working on a text classification model in this project 
that examines the textual description of a query and generates 
numerous labels for it. Multi-Label Text Classification, a 
subset of multiple output models, will be used to construct a 
multilabel text classification strategy for a tag recommendation 
system.

Key Words: text classification, categorization, natural 
language processing, textual data, generic tags.
